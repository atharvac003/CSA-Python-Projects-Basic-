# CSA-Basic-Python-Projects:
These are projects I built as I am currently progressing through an online Python Bootcamp
1) The first is a "Caesar Cipher" that is based on shifting each letter of an input plaintext message by a certain number of letters
2) The second is a classic "Hangman" game with complete ASCII art to signal progress of the player with a diverse list of words to guess from
3) The last is a relatively simple "Password Generator" that operates on user request for symbols, etc
